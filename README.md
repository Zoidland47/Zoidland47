# About me ðŸ‘‹

**Zoidland47/Zoidland47** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on preparing to move our repos from ADO to GitHub. Wish me luck!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about GitHub.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with remembering how to do things like code. It's been a while!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: It is *not* in fact impossible to hum while holding your nose, but it *is* tremendously difficult to do.
